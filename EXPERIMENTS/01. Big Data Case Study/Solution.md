## How Walmart's Data is an example of Big Data

- **Volume**: This refers to the amount of data that is generated and stored by an organization or a system. Walmart handles a huge amount of data from approximately 10,500 stores and clubs, 2.3 million associates, and 100 million unique visitors a month onlineÂ¹. This data is measured in petabytes and exabytes, which are beyond the capacity of traditional data management systems. Walmart uses big data technologies such as Hadoop and NoSQL to store, process, and analyze this massive volume of data.
- **Velocity**: This refers to the speed at which data is created and processed by an organization or a system. Walmart collects and processes data continuously through online shopping, in-store transactions, mobile apps usage etc., requiring real-time or near-real-time processing. This data is generated at a high velocity, which poses challenges for data capture, ingestion, and analysis. Walmart uses big data technologies such as Kafka and Spark to handle the streaming data and provide fast and accurate insights.
- **Variety**: This refers to the diversity of data types and formats that an organization or a system deals with. Walmart deals with data in various formats and types, such as e-commerce websites, physical stores, mobile apps etc., combining structured and unstructured data. This data includes text, images, videos, audio, sensor data, geospatial data, and more. This data is heterogeneous and complex, which requires different methods and tools for data integration, transformation, and analysis. Walmart uses big data technologies such as Hive and MongoDB to handle the variety of data and provide a unified view of the data.
- **Veracity**: This refers to the quality and reliability of data that an organization or a system uses. Walmart needs to ensure the quality and accuracy of the data it uses, as it affects its business decisions and customer satisfaction. This data may be incomplete, inconsistent, noisy, or erroneous, which can lead to inaccurate or misleading results. Walmart uses big data technologies such as Data Quality Services and Data Governance to ensure the veracity of data and provide trusted and reliable data.
- **Value**: This refers to the potential value that data can provide to an organization or a system. Walmart leverages this vast amount of data for innovations like Curbside Pickup and Mobile Scan & Go to enhance customer experience and streamline operations. This data can also help Walmart to optimize its pricing, inventory, supply chain, marketing, and more. Walmart uses big data technologies such as Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to extract value from data and provide actionable insights and recommendations.
- **Variability**: This refers to the inconsistency and fluctuation of data that an organization or a system faces. Walmart faces variability in the data load and processing times, especially during peak times or seasons, such as holidays or festivals. This data may have different patterns, trends, or spikes, which can affect the performance and scalability of the data systems. Walmart uses big data technologies such as Cloud Computing and Elasticity to handle the variability of data and provide flexible and scalable data solutions.
- **Vulnerability** (although not one of the traditional Vs): This refers to the security and privacy of data that an organization or a system holds. Walmart holds a lot of sensitive and personal data of its customers, associates, and partners, which can be vulnerable to cyberattacks, data breaches, or data leaks. This data needs to be protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, which can cause reputational, legal, or financial damages. Walmart uses big data technologies such as Encryption and Authentication to ensure the vulnerability of data and provide secure and compliant data solutions.

I hope this helps you understand how the 7V's of big data apply to Walmart. ðŸ˜Š
